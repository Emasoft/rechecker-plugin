# merge-worktrees.sh — Merge all rechecker worktree branches and clean up
#
# Standalone script. Only requires: git, bash. No Claude Code dependency.
# Run from any git repo where the rechecker plugin created worktrees.
#
# Usage:
#   bash merge-worktrees.sh [--dry-run] [--ours-on-conflict] [--no-cleanup]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run           Show what would be merged without doing it
#   --ours-on-conflict  Auto-resolve conflicts by preferring current branch (ours)
#   --no-cleanup        Skip worktree/branch/file cleanup after merging
